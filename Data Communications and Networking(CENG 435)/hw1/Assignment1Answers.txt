1 - It did not perform any DNS queries to resolve the IP address of http://ceng.metu.edu.tr This is because I visited that website before and its IP address is already known by the browser.
2 - No11(0.788190) -> No28(0.951224) -> No36(0.953771) -> No37(0.953858) -> No44(0.955800)
3 - I added both programming languages and speaking languages since I don't know which one you want

4 - No I have not sent any cookie request in the first HTTP request to server 
5 - Easy way ==> right click->follow->TCP stream(or http stream depending on what you are looking for)
	Long way ==> click on the response/request, enlarge the "Transmission Control Protocol"(TCP) list. The stream index of request will be the same as the stream index of the response.
6 - I set the source to my ip, destination to websites ip and started counting SYN's and FIN's in tcp's since SYN's indicate start of a connection and FIN indicates end.(tcp and ip.src_host == 144.122.107.192 and ip.dst_host == 144.122.145.146). The list of stream indices opening and closing is as follows:
	stream index / action
	0<- open
	1<- open
	2<- open
	3<- open
	4<- open
	1<- close
	5<- open
	3<- close
	6<- open
	7<- open
	2<- close
	4<- close
	8<- open
	9<- open
	5<- close
	10<- open
	9<- close
	11<- open
	7<- close
	12<- open
	12<- close
	13<- open
	11<- close
	14<- open
	...close one then open another(if needed)
	We can clearly see that after opening 9th stream index's connection we only open a connection after we close one connection. The most number of connections active at one time is 6, hence number of parrallel connections is 6.
