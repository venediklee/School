Currently running train.py will test the hyper parameters(train.py lines 213-245)

There are commented sections in train.py that are used for saving/evaluating etc. Each section has its own comment at the top so you don't need to look at here. 
Sorry for I have not made them as functions

To save a model, uncomment lines 168-175 (don't forget to recomment these parts after running them)

To evalue the saved model, uncomment lines 178-183

To draw the graph(trains the model for 50 epochs), uncomment lines 186-190

To print the predictions for test split, uncomment lines 193-201

Lines 205-209 are used for questions 1.1 and 1.2
