Scripts are located in this folder. You can just execute dt.py for decision tree related parts and SVM.py for svm related parts. The main functions will do the work one by one.

Note:drawings of the trees are made with an online tool at https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/ because I couldn't install graphviz on my computer succesfully.
Therefore only the .dot files are generated by my script. I also put the render function in a try catch block to prevent exceptions to stop the execution of the program on my computer. You probably won't see any errors related to this

Relevant scripts: "dt.py", "SVM.py"
Relevant folders: "DecisionTreeOutputs", "SVMOutputs"

Some extra folders are generated by the visual studio IDE, ignore them
