---------------ASSIGNMENT 4----------------------------------
Added fireworks controls

-FireworksDemo.cs is firework class & demo implementation
---press 1-9 to activate a firework

!!!!! You have to set isFireworksDemoActive and isParticleDemoActive variables to true or false(inside the editor) depending on what you want to do



---------------ASSIGNMENT 3----------------------------------
Added wasd to add forces to all particles(need to press wasd again to apply them after shooting)

realized a crucial mistake: if I don't set the acceleration to zero vector some of the particles will not behave correctly.(fixed)

---------------ASSIGNMENT 1----------------------------------

uploaded the whole project just in case(unity 2018.1.5f1)


scripts are in Assets\PhysicsEngine
-MyVector3.cs is vector3 class implementation

-ParticleDemo.cs is playtest code
---press 1-2-3-4-5 to change particle type
